# Pair Programming is allowed for some PAs. For those PAs:

* One student hosts the repo and invite the other student to join the repo.
* Both students can discuss and collaborate in any way. Code commits need to be performed separately using their own github accounts. Both students are expected to make meaningful contributions to the code base.
* Both students need to submit the repo URL in Backboard as a submission comment separately. If you are commiting code to your teammate's repo, make it clear in your BB submission comment.
