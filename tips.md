# Rust Tips

* "eprint!" and "eprintln!" are the stderr equivalent of "print!" and "println!". You can simply use "eprint!" and "eprintln!" to print output to stderr.
* You can use "cargo run some_file.o 1> some_other_file" to print stdout to a file or "cargo run some_file.o 2> some_other_file" to print stderr to a file.


# Blackboard Weighted Total
The blackboard weighted total is a weighted total of percentages of each individual item, not on the total points. It could be misleading when not all items are graded.
